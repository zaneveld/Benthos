    <h1>The Science of Benthos</h1>
    <p>Benthos is based on the science of coral reefs. As part of our research on the Global Coral Microbiome Project, which surveys the types of microbes on corals around the world, we wanted to design a game that could give the feeling of how reef ecology microbiology, and human impacts interact. Each card was designed to reflect real interactions documented by reef science.

   <h2 align="left">Corals are Animals powered by Symbiosis and Sunlight</h2>
   Corals are animals. Unlike most animals, stony corals have microbes called Symbiodineaceae inside their cells. You may hear these referred to as corals symbionts (although they have many types of symbionts), algae, zooxanthellae or <i>Symbiodinium</i>. Whatever the name, Symbiodineaceae make energy for the corals by harvesting light.

   <h2 align="left">Corals and Algae Compete</h2>
   Many scientists think corals and macroalgae ("big algae" or seaweeds) compete for space on coral reefs. This competition can take many forms. For example, some experiments show that coral larvae can't settle down onto the reef as well if macroalgae are nearby. Others suggest that toxins from macroalgae may poison corals. Still others indicate that by shading corals, macroalgae may stop their Symbiodineaceae symbionts from gathering energy from sunlight as efficiently.

   <h2 align="left">Corals are Ancient and Diverse </h2>
   One reason we are so interested in corals is that they are an ancient, highly diverse group of animals. Of course, every living creature is just as 'modern' as any other, but corals as a group have been diversifying (splitting into different species) for far longer than flowering plants or placental mammals. The earliest coral fossils stretch back nearly 500 million years, while stony corals like we see today are as old as 250 million years. In contrast, flowering plants (Angiosperms) are about 120 million years old, and placental mammals are only about 80 million years old.

   <h2>Corals and Microbes evolved together</h2>
   All of this animal diversity is tiny compared to the diversity of microorganisms. All animal species alive today evolved in the context of immense microbial diversity. Most animals are associated with a <i>microbiome</i> - a community of microorganisms and their associated genes. Many of these microbiomes have been shown to influence important properties of animals - what foods they can digest, their ability to fend off disease-causing pathogens, and how their immune system develops. Some have even been shown to influence complex behaviors like mate choice! </p>

   <h1> Further Reading </h1>

   <h2>Learn about python coding and bioinformatics</h2>
   Much of our research on the Global Coral Microbiome Project is heavily computational. If you'd like to learn some basic python useful for bioinformatics and try it out in a project you design, check out <a href="www.github.com/zaneveld/Full_Spectrum_Bioinformatics/">Full Spectrum Bioinformatics</a> a *free*, online bioinformatics textbook designed to support active learning. It has sections on coding, reading the literature, designing a testable hypothesis, analyzing data, and making beautiful visualizations.
