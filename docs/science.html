    <h1>The Science of Benthos</h1>
    <p>Benthos is based on the science of coral reefs. As part of our research on the Global Coral Microbiome Project, which surveys the types of microbes on corals around the world, we wanted to design a game that could give the feeling of how reef ecology microbiology, and human impacts interact. Each card was designed to reflect real interactions documented by reef science.

            <h2>Corals are Animals Powered by Symbiosis and Sunlight</h2>
            <p>
                Corals are animals. Unlike most animals, stony corals have microbes called Symbiodineaceae inside their cells. 
                You may hear these referred to as coral symbionts, algae, zooxanthellae, or <i>Symbiodinium</i>.
                Reef scientists now know that these symbionts are a diverse group of dinoflagellates that form a whole family called  Symbiodineaceae. These Symbiodineaceae make energy for the corals by harvesting light. Some seem to be better at making a lot of energy for the coral, while others appear to be better at maintaining symbiosis with corals at high temperatures.

        <h2 align="left">Corals and Algae Compete</h2>
        <p>
        Many scientists think corals and macroalgae ("big algae" or seaweeds) compete for space on coral reefs. This competition can take many forms. For example, some experiments show that coral larvae can't settle down onto the reef as well if macroalgae are nearby. Others suggest that toxins from macroalgae may poison corals. Still others indicate that by shading corals, macroalgae may stop their Symbiodineaceae symbionts from gathering energy from sunlight as efficiently.

        <h2 align="left">Corals are Ancient and Diverse </h2>
        <p>
        One reason we are so interested in corals is that they are an ancient, highly diverse group of animals. Of course, every living creature is just as 'modern' as any other, but corals as a group have been diversifying (splitting into different species) for far longer than flowering plants or placental mammals. The earliest coral fossils stretch back nearly 500 million years, while stony corals like we see today are as old as 250 million years. In contrast, flowering plants (Angiosperms) are about 120 million years old, and placental mammals are only about 80 million years old.

        <h2>Corals and Microbes evolved together</h2>
        <p>
   All of this animal diversity is tiny compared to the diversity of microorganisms. All animal species alive today evolved in the context of immense microbial diversity. Most animals are associated with a <i>microbiome</i> - a community of microorganisms and their associated genes. Many of these microbiomes have been shown to influence important properties of animals - what foods they can digest, their ability to fend off disease-causing pathogens, and how their immune system develops. Some have even been shown to influence complex behaviors like mate choice! </p>

        <h2> Tradeoffs and the Microbiome </h2>
   <p>
   One idea that researchers are exploring is whether symbiosis with microbes can lead to tradeoffs in animal or plant traits. For example, in comparing microbes and disease susceptibility among coral species, the Global Coral Microbiome Project <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42523-024-00370-z"> found that </a> coral species with more of a group of bacteria called <i> Endozoicomonas </i> living in their tissues grew faster than other corals. However, they also tended to more commonly develop disease. Current research aims to confirm in the laboratory whether <i>Endozoicomonas</i> really causes faster growth under good conditions but greater vulnerability when a coral is attacked by disease.

        <h2> Human Impacts Threaten Reefs </h2>
    <p>
    Demographic, technological and economic changes in the Carribean, mostly after colonization, have produced multiple threats to the ancient diversity of coral reefs and their microbial symbionts at local scales. To understand these threats, we have to return to talking about some of the factors that influence the competition for space on the benthos between corals and macroalgae.

        <h2> On Healthy Reefs, Living Lawnmowers devour Algae </h2>
    <p>
    Before the 1980s, great mobs of black-spined <i>Diadema</i> urchins were a common sight on Caribbean reefs. These urchins scoured algae from the reef, clearing space for vast thickets of Elkhorn and Staghorn corals to flourish. However, in the mid-1980s <i>Diadema</i> urchins began dying in mass numbers from a mysterious disease. The cause has never been definitively worked out. However, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adg3200">recent research on a similar outbreak</a> suggests that a ciliate from genus <i>Philaster</i> is the cause of this disease. This die-off of one of the reef's key living lawnmowers set in motion a chain of events that transformed many reefs in the region.

        <h2> Phase shifts transform reefs </h2>
    <p>
    Scientists suspect that at least some features of reefs are self-perpetuating. When coral almost entirely dominate a reef, it can be hard for large macroalgae to find room to establish. So on many reefs, even after the loss of urchins, corals continued to dominate for a time through a sort of ecological momentum. However, when a disturbance shook up the order on reefs, the absence of urchins could become critical.
