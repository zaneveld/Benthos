    <h1>Online Rules</h1>
    
    <p>In Benthos, you will take on the role of Coral or Algae and use everything from fish and snails to pollution and hurricanes to compete for control of a tropical reef!</p>
    <p>
    <h2>Components</h2>
    <h3>Cards</h3>
    1 Island Card
    2 Role Cards
    10 Algae starting cards
    10 Coral starting cards
    Reef I Cards 
    Reef II Cards
    Reef III Cards
    <h3>Dice</h3>
    <p>20 small Yellow 6-Sided Biomass Dice</p>
    <p>9 small Purple 6-Sided Resistance Dice</p>
    <p>3 Large Dice for tracking Villages (Black), Global Warming (Red) and Awareness (Green)</p>
    <p>2 8-sided Victory Dice</p> 

    <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
    <p>Benthos is a deck-building game. You will start with a deck of Coral or Algae, draw a hand, and take turns playing cards to do one of 3 types of actions.  Many cards will represent creatures that you play around a central Island card. Over time, you can recruit Creature, Microbe, and Event cards into your deck to improve it.</p>

    <p>Throughout the game, Benthos uses dice as counters to track change on the reef: from the biomass and resistance of Creature cards to Villages, Awareness and Global Warming on the nearby Island. These changes in turn affect gameplay - creatures with more biomass deal more damage when they eat, while features of the Island unlock powerful late game events. Villages and Global Warming unlock events like Nutrient Pollution and Mass Coral Bleaching that favor Algae, while Awareness unlocks events like Coral Replanting, Marine Protected Area and Radical Decarbonization that favor Corals.</p> 
   
    <p>Each card in your hand represents one action. On your turn you can use one card from your hand to do one of three actions: Play a Coral, Algae, Creature, Event or Microbe card; discard a card to develop a creature already on the reef; or discard a card to recruit a new card into your deck for next round. You can repeat the same type of action more than once, playing a card each time, before passing the turn.  The round ends when all players are out of cards. Therefore, if you can draw extra cards, you get extra actions.  At the end of each round, a Victory point is awarded to the player that controls the Benthos with Coral or Algae, or both in case of a tie. Players that don't get any points get a special Turn the Tide action that can help them catch up. Reach 8 Victory points to immediately  win the game!</p>
    
    <h2> Playing Benthos with 3-6 players</h2>
    The default rules are written for 2 players. For larger groups, all rules remaint he same, except as noted below.
    
    <h3> Playing with 4 or 6 players </h3> Adjust scoring, starting decks and hand size as discussed below. In a 4 or 6 player game, players play a specific species of Coral or Algae, and the Algal Exudates and Coral Spawning cards are shuffled into the Reef I deck instead of starting in a Coral deck. Players sit so Coral and Algae alternate around the table. At the end of the round, ALL Coral players score if there are equal or more Coral than Algae (and vice versa), but players can also individually score 1 point if they have equal or more Coral cards of their species on the reef than any other Coral player, or equal or more Algae cards on the reef than any other Algae player. In a 3+ player game, ALL players that fail to score points may Turn the Tide (see below for rules) in turn order. 
 
    <p> <b>4 player game:</b> Pick 2 Coral players and 2 Algae players. Each player picks one species, and starts with all Coral/Algae cards from that species. Shuffle Coral Spawning and Algal Exudates into the Reef I deck. Players draw only 3 cards per turn (instead of 4)
    <p> <b>6 player game:</b> Pick 3 Coral players and 3 Algae players. Each player picks one species, and starts with all Coral/Algae cards from that species. Shuffle Coral Spawning and Algal Exudates into the Reef I deck. Players draw only 2 cards per turn (instead of 4) 

    <h3> Playing with 3 or 5 players </h3> If playing with an odd number of players, rules are the same as for a 4 or 6 player game,except as noted. Divide players as evenly as possible between Corals and Algae, with 1 side having an extra player (3 Coral players and 2 Algae players or 2 Algae and 3 Coral). Each player picks a single species and starts with all Coral or Algae cards for that species. Players on the smaller side draw 1 extra card each turn (total hand size 4 in a 3 player game or 3 in a 5 player game). If a player in a 3 player game is the *only* player on their side, they score 1 point for having the most abundant species on their side if they have even a single Coral or Algae card on the reef at end of round. 
    <p> <b>3 player game:</b>Pick 2 Coral Players and 1 Algae player (or vice versa). Each player picks one species and starts with all Coral/Algae cards from that species. Shuffle Coral Spawning and Algal Exudates into the Reef I deck. The side with a single player draws 4 cards per turn, while players on the larger side draw 3 cards per turn.</p>
    <p> <b>5 player game:</b>Pick 3 Coral Players and 2 Algae players (or vice versa). Each player picks one species and starts with all Coral/Algae cards from that species. Shuffle Coral Spawning and Algal Exudates into the Reef I deck. The side with a single player draws 3 cards per turn, while players on the larger side draw 2 cards per turn.</p>
    
    <h2>Setting up the Decks</h2>
    <h3>1. Separate the Decks </h3>
    <p> Separate the Decks. Sort out all the cards  into decks by matching the symbol on the right edge of  each card to one of those shown below. Shuffle each deck.</p>
    <h3>2. Set up the Reef </h3>
    <p> Set up the Reef as shown below. </p>
    <p> First, find The Island card and place it into the center of the table. Leave empty space room for 2 cards in all directions. Coral and Algae will be played touching the Island (tan spaces), while Creature cards will be played touching The Island,  Corals or Algae.
    <h3>3. Set Victory Points to 1</h3>
    <p> Give each player an eight-sided Victory die to count Victory points, and set it to 1. Give the Algae Player the Algae deck & ‘Algae Setup’ Card, and the Coral Player the Coral Deck & ‘Coral Setup”.
    <p> <b>2 player game:</b> Players only keep Coral or Algae cards without a 3+ player icon (return the rest to the box). Players draw 4 cards each turn. </p>
    <p> <b>3-6 player game:</b> Follow the 2 player rules except as noted above.
   
    <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
Play proceeds in rounds. Each round, players take turns using one  card from their hand to play an action. The same type of action can be repeated if desired using additional cards before passing the turn. The round ends when both player’s hands are empty.
